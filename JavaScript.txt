What is a JavaScript?
-JavaScript is a Scripting Language
-JS is a High level programming Language
-Js is a Weakly/loosely typed language.
-JS is a LightWeight and dynamic language used to build user interface(Presentation layer).

-JS Introduced in 1995 by brenden eich.
-Netscape navigator.
- the first program named it as "Mocha"
-The first name for javascript is "Livescript" later it is renamed as "JavaScript".

Applications of js:
**********
Mobile apps,smartwatch,gaming,web apps, server side apps, data(mongoDB).

Varaibles:
-The Varaibles are nothing but containers/memory blocks used to store the data.
-Variables are case-sensitive.
-Start with letters, _(underScore), $(dollarsign)
-cant start with numbers
-Reserved words(Keywords) not allowed.
-Allow letters,_(underScore),$(dollarsign),numbers.

Reuasable code:
        var a=1
        a=5
        console.log(a+a)
        Output:10

-types of Varaibles:
  1. var(1995-)
  2. let (2015-es6)
  3. const() (2015-es6)

Idnetifiers- Identifiers are the name given for memory(Varaibles). 

Redeclaring with var is accepted:
Example-
  var a=1
  var a=5
  document.write(a+a)
  console.log(a+a)
    Output: 10

-Reassinging with let & var is accepted
Example:
int a=6
a=7
console.log(a)
output:7

Redeclaring with let is not accepted:
Example:
let a=1;
let a=5;
document.write(a+a)
console.log(a+a)
  Output: Error

Redeclaring with const is not accepted

DataTypes:
1) Dynamic type language
Two types:
1) Primitive data type
2) Non-primitive data type 
To check the data type- typeOf 

Primitive data type: predefined; we can store single values
Numbers:integers,floats
String: Steam of characters enclosed in quotes
--Single,double, backtick quotes; 
Boolean: true or false
Null: empty vslues or data that haas no value 
Undefined: A declared variable with no value 

Numbers: 1,-1,-4.4,5.5

--backticks introduced in ES6 version 
--It provides the extra functionality;; we can insert the variables into them

String concatination:

a=Abishek
b=bhargav

Reactjs Student=Abishek bhargav 

JavaScript Operators:
1. Arithemetic operators: +,-,*,/
Division                         - /__(Q)
Modulus operator                 - %__(R)
Exponential(Raised to the power) -**
++,
--

        let a=10;
        let b=5;
          b++
          a--
          document.write(b,"<br>")
          document.write(a,"<br>")
        document.write(a%b,"<br>")
        //Remainder part
        document.write(a/b,"<br>")
        //Quotient part 
        document.write(a*b,"<br>")
        document.write(a**b)

Assignment:
var student="swetha"
+=
-=
/=
%=
*=

Logical Operators:
and  &&
T and T=T
or   ||
T or F=F
not !

Relational(Comparision) Operators:
<,>,>=,<=,==,!=,===,!===
== - equality

conditional operator; ternary operator(?)
First it will evalautes an expression for a true or false;
if the condition is true the first expression will execute
otherwise next expression will execute.

Syntax:
Condition? e1:e2 

window methods:
alert()
prompt(): to tske input from the user
