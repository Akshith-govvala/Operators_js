1.write a program to check whether the number is divisible by 2&3 and both.
2. write a program to find the largest number out of three numbers expected from the user:
 A=11,B=5,C=8
3. Accept the following from the user and calculate the percentages of classes
attended:
a. Total number of working days
b. Total number of days absent
after calculating percentage show that, if the percentage is less than 75,
then student will not be eligible to write exam.
3rd ans: let w=parseInt(prompt("enter total number of days"))
         let A=parseInt(prompt("enter total number of days"))\
         let p=w-A
         let AP=(P/W)*100
         if(AP>=75){
          document.write("eligible")
         } else{
          document.write("Not eligible")
         }

Ask the user for their salary and years of service and print the bonus amount 
Ans:let a=parseInt(prompt("salary"))
        let b=parseInt(prompt("years of service"))
        if(b>10){
            let c=a*0.1
            let d=c+a
            alert("after bonus salary"+d)
        }
        else if(b>=6 && b<=10){
            let c=a*0.08
            let d=c+a
            alert("after bonus salary"+d)
        }
        else if(b<6){
            let c=a*0.05
            let d=c+a
            alert("after bonus salary"+a)
        }
        else{
            alert(a)
